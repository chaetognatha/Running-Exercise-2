    Title: Running Exercise II: amino count
    Version: 1
    Date: 2020-10-18
    Author(s): Mattis Knulst, JÃºlia Ortis

    Description: Simple program for counting absolute abundances of amino acids in sequences and printing them to a file
    - the list of amino acids can consist of any string e.g. "A" or "a" or "Ala" or "ala" but must be in one column with
    one string per line.


    List of functions:
        get_fasta() extracts headers and sequences in a fasta file and returns them as a dictionary
        count_aas() takes an amino acid string and returns absolute counts of amino acids

    List of "non standard" modules:
        No non standard modules are used in the program.

    Procedure:
    1. Extract headers and sequences using get_fasta()
    2. open output file
    3. send sequences to be counted in count_aas()
    4. print headers and abundance counts to output file


    Usage:
         python amino_count.py amino.faa amino.list output_file.txt
