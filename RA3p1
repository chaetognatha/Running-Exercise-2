create fasta file for mtDNA and for Y chromosome

Do the MSA, maybe save it into another file?
For MSA we need to choose gap penalty model along with gap penalty values and 
subs matrix
0. Find the two seqs that give the highest alignment score
1. look at each two seqs (e.g. a and b), calculate pairwise alignment score
2.total alignment score is then a sum of all pairwise alig.scores
- so e.g. if we have seqs a,b,c,d, then the sum S= Sab + Sac + Sad +Sbc + Sbd + 
Scd 


Then in the final file, do the scoring: transitions, transversions and 
gaps have different penalties. 

output MSA results to a file looking like this
SampleA SampleB IdentityScore Score
A1 A2 55.2% 35
A1 A3 51.3% 17
